            <div class="content">
                <p>Python provides the standard library Tkinter for creating the graphical user interface for desktop
                    based applications.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Developing desktop based applications with python Tkinter is not a complex task. An empty Tkinter
                    top-level window can be created by using the following steps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Import the Tkinter module.
                    <br>
                    Create the main application window.
                    <br>
                    Add the widgets like labels, buttons, frames, etc. to the window.
                    <br>
                    Call the main event loop so that the actions can take place on the user's computer screen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Bank Application is a simple Python GUI (Graphical User Interface) based project, which consists the
                    feature such as enquiry, withdraw and deposit. I Designed a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
                    application using Python. It is a application which can be used in banking system. In this project I
                    used file system for storing and retrieving data.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To use this application firstly you need to signup and create an account. Use the same username and
                    password to login the application after a successful login there will be three options displayed on
                    the screen click on enquiry for checking the balance. Click on the deposit button where you need to
                    enter the amount you want to deposit after this your amount is deposited in your account and a
                    successful message is displayed on the screen. To withdraw the money click on withdraw button and
                    enter the amount less than the amount in the account else it will display an error message. After
                    withdrawing the amount is deducted from main account.
                </p>
                <h2>Data Storage</h2>
                <p>It uses file system to store data in which the user password and also the amount is stored safely.
                    Whenever user try to enquiry the balance in the file is displayed on the screen.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If the user uses deposit option and enters a valid amount then that amount is added to the previous
                    amount in the file. (Note : Initially the file contains value zero which helps in arithimetic
                    operations easily)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If the user uses withdraw option and enters a value that value is checked initially with the value
                    in file if entered value is greater than file value then an error message is displayed else the
                    entered amount is deducted from the file value and the new balance is updated safely. It is quick
                    and simple.
